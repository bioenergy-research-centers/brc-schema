  title: Two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra
    of lignin isolated from Populus trichocarpa residues after CELF pretreatment and
    CBP fermentation
  description: 'Here we present a curated dataset of a series of two-dimensional heteronuclear
    single quantum coherence (HSQC) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of lignin
    isolated from a woody energy crop (Populus trichocarpa) residues after co-solvent
    enhanced lignocellulosic fractionation (CELF) pretreatment and consolidated bioprocessing
    (CBP) process. The natural poplar variant GW-9947 from the Center for Bioenergy
    Innovation (CBI) was used. The poplar was knife milled and passed through a 1
    mm sieve. The CELF pretreatment was performed in a Parr autoclave reactor with
    7.5 wt % solids loading, 0.5 wt% H2SO4 as catalyst at 150°C with 15, 25 and 30
    minutes, respectively. Tetrahydrofuran was added in a 1:1 mass ratio with water
    as the pretreatment solvent. The residues from CELF pretreatment were then subjected
    to CBP using the bacterium C. thermocellum DSM 1313. CBP fermentations were performed
    at 60 °C in a shaker at 50 grams/L solids loadings. Lignin was isolated from the
    pretreated samples after ball-milling in a porcelain jar with ceramic balls via
    Retsch PM 200 at 580 rpm for 2.5 h followed by enzymatic hydrolysis in acetate
    buffer (pH 4.8, 50 °C) for 48 h. The lignin samples were characterized using 13C–1H
    HSQC experiments which were performed in a Bruker Avance III HD 500 MHz NMR spectrometer
    operating at a frequency of 125.12 MHz for the 13C nucleus. A standard Bruker
    pulse sequence was used on a Prodigy platform cryoprobe. The dry lignin samples
    were dissolved in deuterated dimethylsulfoxide for HSQC experiments. The spectra
    were acquired under the following acquisition conditions: 210 ppm spectral width
    in F1 (13C) dimension with 256 data points and 11 ppm spectral width in F2 (1H)
    dimension with 1024 data points, a 90° pulse, a one bond C–H coupling constant
    of 145 Hz, a 1.0 s pulse delay, and 64 scans. All the data was processed using
    the TopSpin 3.6 software (Bruker BioSpin). The NMR spectra provides structural
    characteristics information about lignin remaining in solids after CELF (150 °C
    with 15, 25 and 30 minutes) process and C. thermocellum CBP.'
