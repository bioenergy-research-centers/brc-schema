# About the BRC Schema

The BRC schema is used with data on the <https://bioenergy.org/> data portal.

It is intended to represent metadata most relevant to the DOE bioenergy research community. It has also been designed to align with the data submission schema used by [OSTI.gov](https://www.osti.gov/).
