	"description": "In this research we used the warm-season grass Miscanthus × giganteus as model herbaceous perennial species to study age-related changes on phenology. Age-related experiments are usually based on field experimental design that confound growing season and age effects and ignore variability generated during the establishment of the stand.  Here, we used a staggered-start experimental design where stands are repeatedly planted over subsequent years providing the ability to separate plant age effects from environmental effects.We hypothesized (i) M. × giganteus would produce more plant structures and reach more advanced developmental stages in a given growing season as it aged. (ii) Juvenile stands would have faster developmental rates and start development sooner and (iii) Mature stands would start senescence sooner in the growing season. Finally, we studied nitrogen (N) fertilization effects on M. × giganteus phenology as to assess whether age-related changes could be an artifact of size and N dilution in mature bigger individuals. We hypothesized that (iv) fertilized juvenile stands would have similar dynamics as mature unfertilized stands. Data were collected bi-weekly on all established stands during 2016 and 2017. Ten stems were harvested from each plot and staged at the lab according to M. × giganteus morphological scale developed by Tejera & Heaton (2017). Time series progression were then analyzed using non-linear models and parameters were compared across stand ages, N treatments and growing seasons. R scripts used to analyze the data are available upon request.",

The daily estimates are SatelLite Only Photosynthesis Estimation (SLOPE) products at 250-m resolution. There are three distinct features of the GPP estimation algorithm: (1) SLOPE couples machine learning models with MODIS atmosphere and land products to accurately estimate PAR, (2) SLOPE couples gap-filling and filtering algorithms with surface reflectance acquired by both Terra and Aqua MODIS satellites to derive a soil-adjusted NIRv (SANIRv) dataset, and (3) SLOPE couples a temporal pattern recognition approach with a long-term Crop Data Layer (CDL) product to predict dynamic C4 crop fraction. PAR, SANIRv and C4 fraction are used to drive a parsimonious model with only two parameters to estimate GPP, along with a quantitative uncertainty, on a per-pixel and daily basis.

Photosynthetic parameters in upper and lower canopy leaves, carbon assimilation, electron transport, stomatal conductance, and activity of three C4-specific photosynthetic enzymes, were compared within a genetically diverse range of accessions varying widely in canopy architecture and thereby in the degree of self-shading. Accessions with erect leaves and high light transmission through the canopy are henceforth referred to as ‘erectophile’ and those with low leaf erectness, ‘planophile’. In the final year of the study, bundle sheath leakiness in erectophile and planophile accessions was also compared.",

This platform consists of a most versatile DNA assembly method using Pyrococcus furiosus Argonaute (PfAgo)-based artificial restriction enzymes, a user-friendly frontend for plasmid design, and a backend that streamlines the workflow and integration with a robotic system. As a proof of concept, we used this platform to generate ~100 plasmids from six different species ranging from 5 to 18 kb in size from up to 11 DNA fragments within 3 days. PlasmidMaker should greatly expand the potential of synthetic biology.",

	"description": "Perennial energy grasses are a fundamental component of the emerging bioeconomy. While their yield dynamics and environmental services are being widely studied, little attention has been given to how the physiological changes associated with perenniality (e.g., nutrient cycling) that underpin yield and environmental services, change as a function of age. Across species, perennial grasses show a photosynthetic decline as a function of stand age, however, the physiological drivers of this age-related decline are poorly understood. In this manuscript we ask: by how much does nitrogen dilution in larger older plants contribute to this photosynthetic decline? Our results support the hypothesis that nitrogen dilution did not limit photosynthesis in mature stands. Compared per unit of area-based leaf nitrogen, photosynthesis of fertilized mature stands was still 26% lower than unfertilized juvenile stands. We hypothesize that the lack of late-season carbohydrate sinks may instead drive the age-related decline in photosynthesis.",

Flights were performed using a DJI M600 mounted with a Micasense Rededge multispectral sensor at 20 m altitude around solar noon. Imagery is available as tif file by field trial and date (10). The post-processing of raw images into orthophoto was performed in Agisoft Metashape software.

Each raster stack includes 6 layers in the following order: Layer 1 = crop surface model, Layer 2 = Blue, Layer 3 = Green, Layer 4 = Red, Layer 5 = Rededge, and Layer 6 = NIR multispectral bands. Msa raster stacks were resampled to 1.67 cm spatial resolution and Msi raster stacks were resampled to 1.41 cm spatial resolution to ease their integration into further analysis. ‘MMDDYYYY’ is the date of data collection, ‘MSA’ is M.
