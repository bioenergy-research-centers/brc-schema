Age-related experiments are usually based on field experimental design that confound growing season and age effects and ignore variability generated during the establishment of the stand.  Here, we used a staggered-start experimental design where stands are repeatedly planted over subsequent years providing the ability to separate plant age effects from environmental effects.We hypothesized (i) M. × giganteus would produce more plant structures and reach more advanced developmental stages in a given growing season as it aged. (ii) Juvenile stands would have faster developmental rates and start development sooner and (iii) Mature stands would start senescence sooner in the growing season. Finally, we studied nitrogen (N) fertilization effects on M. × giganteus phenology as to assess whether age-related changes could be an artifact of size and N dilution in mature bigger individuals. We hypothesized that (iv) fertilized juvenile stands would have similar dynamics as mature unfertilized stands. Data were collected bi-weekly on all established stands during 2016 and 2017. Ten stems were harvested from each plot and staged at the lab according to M. × giganteus morphological scale developed by Tejera & Heaton (2017). Time series progression were then analyzed using non-linear models and parameters were compared across stand ages, N treatments and growing seasons. R scripts used to analyze the data are available upon request.",

PAR, SANIRv and C4 fraction are used to drive a parsimonious model with only two parameters to estimate GPP, along with a quantitative uncertainty, on a per-pixel and daily basis.

Photosynthetic parameters in upper and lower canopy leaves, carbon assimilation, electron transport, stomatal conductance, and activity of three C4-specific photosynthetic enzymes, were compared within a genetically diverse range of accessions varying widely in canopy architecture and thereby in the degree of self-shading. Accessions with erect leaves and high light transmission through the canopy are henceforth referred to as ‘erectophile’ and those with low leaf erectness, ‘planophile’. In the final year of the study, bundle sheath leakiness in erectophile and planophile accessions was also compared.",

This platform consists of a most versatile DNA assembly method using Pyrococcus furiosus Argonaute (PfAgo)-based artificial restriction enzymes, a user-friendly frontend for plasmid design, and a backend that streamlines the workflow and integration with a robotic system. As a proof of concept, we used this platform to generate ~100 plasmids from six different species ranging from 5 to 18 kb in size from up to 11 DNA fragments within 3 days. PlasmidMaker should greatly expand the potential of synthetic biology.",

In addition, we studied how establishment conditions affected mxg yield response to N fertilization.  This is the first repeated planting year experiment conducted on perennial bioenergy grasses. Data showed that mxg yield response to N fertilization was highly variable. Establishment effects were an important driver of this variability and caused significant changes on the magnitude and direction of one-year-old stands’ response to N fertilization. With repeated planting we compared yield gain from first to second year of growth of different single starts. Yield gain of each single start was different within and between sites. This site-specific response suggests that important biases could be introduced when comparing results across studies if repeated planting is not utilized. ",

	"description": "Perennial energy grasses are a fundamental component of the emerging bioeconomy. While their yield dynamics and environmental services are being widely studied, little attention has been given to how the physiological changes associated with perenniality (e.g., nutrient cycling) that underpin yield and environmental services, change as a function of age. Across species, perennial grasses show a photosynthetic decline as a function of stand age, however, the physiological drivers of this age-related decline are poorly understood. In this manuscript we ask: by how much does nitrogen dilution in larger older plants contribute to this photosynthetic decline? Our results support the hypothesis that nitrogen dilution did not limit photosynthesis in mature stands. Compared per unit of area-based leaf nitrogen, photosynthesis of fertilized mature stands was still 26% lower than unfertilized juvenile stands. We hypothesize that the lack of late-season carbohydrate sinks may instead drive the age-related decline in photosynthesis.",

	"description": "Herein we report that ene reductases (EREDs) can facilitate an unprecedented intramolecular β-C−H functionalization reaction for the synthesis of bridged bicyclic nitrogen heterocycles containing the 6-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold. To streamline the synthesis of these privileged motifs, we developed a gram-scale one-pot chemoenzymatic cascade by combining iridium photocatalysis with EREDs, using readily available N-phenylglycines and cyclohexenones that can be obtained from biomass. Further derivatization using enzymatic or chemical methods can convert 6-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-one into 6-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3α-ols, which can be potentially utilized for the synthesis of azaprophen and its analogues for drug discovery. Mechanistic studies revealed the reaction requires oxygen, presumably to produce oxidized flavin, which can selectively dehydrogenate the 3-substituted cyclohexanone derivatives to form the α,β-unsaturated ketone, which subsequently undergoes spontaneous intramolecular aza-Michael addition under basic conditions.",

A promising chemical screening approach is the measurement of products directly from microbial colonies via optically guided matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Measuring the compounds from microbial colonies bypasses liquid culture with a screen that takes approximately 5 s per sample. We describe a protocol combining a dedicated informatics pipeline and sample preparation method that can prepare up to 3,000 colonies in under 3 h. The screening protocol starts from colonies grown on Petri dishes and then transferred onto MALDI plates via imprinting. The target plate with the colonies is imaged by a flatbed scanner and the colonies are located via custom software. The target plate is coated with MALDI matrix, MALDI-MS analyzes the colony locations, and data analysis enables the determination of colonies with the desired biochemical properties. This workflow screens thousands of colonies per day without requiring additional automation. The wide chemical coverage and the high sensitivity of MALDI-MS enable diverse screening projects such as modifying enzymes and functional genomics surveys of gene activation/inhibition libraries.",

Sustainable agricultural intensification holds promise in achieving ecosystem service multifunctionality beyond food production, yet empirical evidence remains tenuous, especially regarding consequences for the metaecosystems (i.e., spatially coupled ecosystems connected by flows across ecosystem boundaries). Here we synthesized long-term datasets encompassing 53 physical, chemical, and biological indicators, comprising >11,000 field measurements, to understand effects of land-use intensification on multiple ecosystem services of spatially connected grasslands and wetlands. The management practices applied to grasslands were not directly imposed on wetlands, except for grazing intensity. Our results revealed that intensification promoted high-quality forage and livestock production in both grasslands and wetlands, but at the expense of water quality regulation, methane mitigation, non-native species invasion resistance, and biodiversity, and further weakened relationships among ecosystem services. Such intensification effects on grasslands cascaded to alter multifunctionality of embedded natural wetlands within the metaecosystems to a similar extent. Our results highlight the need to integrate holistic and systematic perspectives into land-use intensification strategies to achieve multifunctional agricultural landscapes.",

	"description": "Orbitrap mass spectrometry in full scan mode enables the simultaneous detection of hundreds of metabolites and their isotope-labeled forms. Yet, sensitivity remains limiting for many metabolites, including low-concentration species, poor ionizers, and low-fractional-abundance isotope-labeled forms in isotope-tracing studies. Here, we explore selected ion monitoring (SIM) as a means of sensitivity enhancement. The analytes of interest are enriched in the orbitrap analyzer by using the quadrupole as a mass filter to select particular ions. In tissue extracts, SIM significantly enhances the detection of ions of low intensity, as indicated by improved signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios and measurement precision. In addition, SIM improves the accuracy of isotope-ratio measurements. SIM, however, must be deployed with care, as excessive accumulation in the orbitrap of similar m/z ions can lead, via space-charge effects, to decreased performance (signal loss, mass shift, and ion coalescence). Ion accumulation can be controlled by adjusting settings including injection time and target ion quantity. Overall, we suggest using a full scan to ensure broad metabolic coverage, in tandem with SIM, for the accurate quantitation of targeted low-intensity ions, and provide methods deploying this approach to enhance metabolome coverage.",

	"description": "Oilcane—an oil-accumulating crop engineered from sugarcane—and microbial oil have the potential to improve renewable oil production and help meet the expected demand for bioderived oleochemicals and fuels. To assess the potential synergies of processing both plant and microbial oils, the economic and environmental implications of integrating microbial oil production at oilcane and sugarcane biorefineries were characterized. Due to decreased crop yields that lead to higher simulated feedstock prices and lower biorefinery capacities, current oilcane prototypes result in higher costs and carbon intensities than microbial oil from sugarcane. To inform oilcane feedstock development, we calculated the required biomass yields (as a function of oil content) for oilcane to achieve financial parity with sugarcane. At 10 dw% oil, oilcane can sustain up to 30% less yield than sugarcane and still be more profitable in all simulated scenarios. Assuming continued improvements in microbial oil production from cane juice, achieving this target results in a minimum biodiesel selling price of 1.34 [0.90, 1.85] USD∙L−1 (presented as median [5th, 95th] percentiles), a carbon intensity of 0.51 [0.47, 0.55] kg CO2e L−1, and a total biodiesel yield of 2140 [1870, 2410] L ha−1year−1. Compared to biofuel production from soybean, this outcome is equivalent to 3.0–3.9 as much biofuel per hectare of land and a 57%–63% reduction in carbon intensity. While only 20% of simulated scenarios fell within the market price range of biodiesel (0.45–1.11 USD∙L−1), if the oilcane biomass yield would improve to 25.6 DMT∙ha−1∙y−1 (an equivalent yield to sugarcane) 87% of evaluated scenarios would have a minimum biodiesel selling price within or below the market price range.",

We develop a photoenzymatic hydrofluoroalkylation that adeptly integrates fluorinated motifs into olefins. The photoinduced promiscuity of flavin-dependent ene-reductases enables generation of carbon-centered radicals from iodinated fluoroalkanes, which are directed by the photoenzyme to engage enantioselectively with olefins. This approach facilitates stereocontrol through interaction between a singular fluorinated unit and the enzyme, securing high enantioselectivity at β-, γ-, or δ-positions of fluorinated groups via enzymatic hydrogen atom transfer, a process notably challenging with conventional chemocatalysis. This work advances enzymatic strategies for integrating fluorinated chemical feedstocks and opens new avenues for asymmetric synthesis of fluorinated compounds.",

	"description": "Stomata regulate CO2 and water vapor exchange between leaves and the atmosphere. Stomata are a target for engineering to improve crop intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE). One example is by expressing genes that lower stomatal density (SD) and reduce stomatal conductance (gsw). However, the quantitative relationship between reduced SD, gsw, and the mechanisms underlying it is poorly understood. We addressed this knowledge gap using low-SD sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrid) as a case study alongside a meta-analysis of data from 10 species. Transgenic expression of EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR 2 from Sorghum bicolor (SbEFP2) in sugarcane reduced SD by 26-38% but did not affect gsw compared to wildtype. Further, no changes occurred in stomatal complex size or proxies for photosynthetic capacity. Measurements of gas exchange at low CO2 concentrations that promote complete stomatal opening to normalize aperture size between genotypes were combined with modeling of maximum gsw from anatomical data. These data suggest that increased stomatal aperture is the only possible explanation for maintaining gsw when SD is reduced. Meta-analysis across C3 dicots, C3 monocots, and C4 monocots revealed engineered reductions in SD are strongly correlated with lower gsw (r2=0.60-0.98), but this response is damped relative to the change in anatomy.",

	"description": "Enhancing crop water use efficiency (WUE) is a key target trait for climatic resilience and expanding cultivation on marginal lands. Engineering lower stomatal density to reduce stomatal conductance (gs) has improved WUE in multiple C3 crop species. However, reducing gs in C3 species often reduces photosynthetic carbon gain. A different response is expected in C4 plants because they possess specialized anatomy and biochemistry which concentrates CO2 at the site of fixation. This modifies the photosynthesis (AN) relationship with intracellular CO2 concentration (ci) so that photosynthesis is CO2-saturated and reductions in gs are unlikely to limit AN. To test this hypothesis, genetic strategies were investigated to reduce stomatal density in the C4 crop sorghum. Constitutive expression of a synthetic epidermal patterning factor (EPF) transgenic allele in sorghum, led to reduced stomatal densities, reduced gs, reduced plant water use and avoidance of stress during a period of water deprivation. In addition, moderate reduction in stomatal density did not increase stomatal limitation to AN. However, these positive outcomes were associated with negative pleiotropic effects on reproductive development and photosynthetic capacity. Avoiding pleiotropy by targeting expression of the transgene to specific tissues could provide a pathway to improved agronomic outcomes.",

	"description": "The expansion of sugarcane, a tropical high-yielding feedstock, will likely reshape the Southeastern United States (SE US) bioenergy landscape. However, the sustainability of sugarcane, particularly as it displaces grazed pastures, is highly uncertain. Here, we investigated how pasture conversion to sugarcane in subtropical Florida impacts net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and net ecosystem carbon (C) balance (NECB). Measurements were made over three full growth cycles (> 3 years) in sugarcane—plant cane, PC; first ratoon cane, FRC; second ratoon cane, SRC—and in improved (IM) and semi-native (SN) pastures, which make up ca. 37% of agricultural land in the region. Immediately following conversion, PC was a stronger net source of CO2 than pastures, indicating the importance of CO2 losses related to land disturbance. Sugarcane, however, shifted to a strong net sink of CO2 after first regrowth, and overall sugarcane was a stronger net CO2 sink than pastures. Both stand age and low water availability during cane emergence and tillering substantially decreased its potential gross CO2 uptake. Accounting for all C gains and removals (i.e., NECB), greater frequency of burn events and repeated harvest increased removals and overall made sugarcane a stronger C source relative to pastures despite substantial C inputs from the previous land use and a stronger CO2 sink strength. Time since conversion substantially reduced C losses from sugarcane, and the NECB of SRC was similar to that of IM pasture but lower than that of SN pasture, indicating a rapid shift in the NECB of cane. We conclude that the C-balance implications following conversion will depend on the proportion of IM versus SN pastures converted to sugarcane. Furthermore, our findings suggest that no-burn harvest management strategies will be critical to the development of a sustainable bioenergy landscape in SE US.",

For microbial inoculants to be effective as agricultural tools, these organisms must be able to survive and persist in novel environments while not destabilizing the resident community or spilling over into adjacent natural ecosystems. Here, we adapt a macroecological propagule pressure model to a microbial scale and present an experimental approach for testing the role of propagule pressure in microbial inoculant introductions. We experimentally determined the risk-release relationship for an IAA-expressing Pseudomonas simiae inoculant in a model monocot system. We then used this relationship to simulate establishment outcomes under a range of application frequencies (propagule number) and inoculant concentrations (propagule size). Our simulations show that repeated inoculant applications may increase establishment, even when increased inoculant concentration does not alter establishment probabilities.",
