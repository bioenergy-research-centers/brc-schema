The Ajugoideae subfamily, in particular, accumulates significant numbers of structurally related furanoclerodanes. The biosynthetic capacity for formation of these diterpenoids is retained across most Lamiaceae subfamilies, including the early-diverging Callicarpoideae which forms a sister clade to the rest of Lamiaceae. VacCYP76BK1, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase from Vitex agnus-castus, was previously found to catalyze the formation of the proposed precursor to furan and lactone-containing labdane diterpenoids. Through transcriptome-guided pathway exploration, we identified orthologs of VacCYP76BK1 in Ajuga reptans and Callicarpa americana",

    "description": "Without fertilization, harvest of perennial bioenergy cropping systems diminishes soil nutrient stocks, yet the time course of nutrient drawdown has not often been investigated. We analyzed phosphorus (P) inputs (fertilization and atmospheric deposition) and outputs (harvest and leaching losses) over 7 years in three representative biomass crops—switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) and hybrid poplar trees (Populus nigra × P. maximowiczii)—as well as in no-till corn (maize; Zea mays L.) for comparison, all planted on former cropland in SW Michigan, USA. Only corn received P fertilizer. Corn (grain and stover), switchgrass, and miscanthus were harvested annually, while poplar was harvested after 6 years. Soil test P (STP; Bray-1 method) was measured in the upper 25 cm of soil annually. Harvest P removal was calculated from tissue P concentration and harvest yield (or annual woody biomass accrual in poplar). Leaching was estimated as total dissolved P concentration in soil solutions sampled beneath the rooting depth (1.25 m), combined with hydrological modeling. Fertilization and harvest were by far the dominant P budget terms for corn, and harvest P removal dominated the P budgets in switchgrass, miscanthus, and poplar, while atmospheric deposition and leaching losses were comparatively insignificant. Because of significant P removal by harvest, the P balances of switchgrass, miscanthus, and poplar were negative and corresponded with decreasing STP, whereas P fertilization compensated for the harvest P removal in corn, resulting in a positive P balance. Results indicate that perennial crop harvest without P fertilization removed legacy P from soils, and continued harvest will soon draw P down to limiting levels, even in soils once heavily P-fertilized. Widespread cultivation of bioenergy crops may, therefore, alter P balances in agricultural landscapes, eventually requiring P fertilization, which could be supplied by P recovery from harvested biomass.",

    "description": "Three yeast isolates were obtained from soil and rotting wood samples collected in an Amazonian rainforest biome in Brazil. Comparison of the intergenic spacer 5.8S region and the D1/D2 domains of the large subunit rRNA gene showed that the isolates represent a novel species of the genus Saccharomycopsis. A tree inferred from the D1/D2 sequences placed the novel species near a subclade containing Saccharomycopsis lassenensis, Saccharomycopsis fermentans, Saccharomycopsis javanensis, Saccharomycopsis babjevae, Saccharomycopsis schoenii and Saccharomycopsis oosterbeekiorum, but with low bootstrap support. In terms of sequence divergence, the novel species had the highest identity in the D1/D2 domains with Saccharomycopsis capsularis, from which it differed by 36 substitutions. In contrast, a phylogenomic analysis based on 1061 single-copy orthologs for a smaller set of Saccharomycopsis species whose whole genome sequences are available indicated that the novel species represented by strain UFMG-CM-Y6991 is phylogenetically closer to Saccharomycopsis fodiens and Saccharomycopsis sp.

    "description": "Three yeast isolates were obtained from soil and rotting wood samples collected in an Amazonian rainforest biome in Brazil. Comparison of the intergenic spacer 5.8S region and the D1/D2 domains of the large subunit rRNA gene showed that the isolates represent a novel species of the genus Saccharomycopsis. A tree inferred from the D1/D2 sequences placed the novel species near a subclade containing Saccharomycopsis lassenensis, Saccharomycopsis fermentans, Saccharomycopsis javanensis, Saccharomycopsis babjevae, Saccharomycopsis schoenii and Saccharomycopsis oosterbeekiorum, but with low bootstrap support. In terms of sequence divergence, the novel species had the highest identity in the D1/D2 domains with Saccharomycopsis capsularis, from which it differed by 36 substitutions. In contrast, a phylogenomic analysis based on 1061 single-copy orthologs for a smaller set of Saccharomycopsis species whose whole genome sequences are available indicated that the novel species represented by strain UFMG-CM-Y6991 is phylogenetically closer to Saccharomycopsis fodiens and Saccharomycopsis sp.

    "title": "Budding yeasts in the subphylum Saccharomycotina Genome sequencing and assembly",
    "description": "Eukaryotic life depends on the functional elements encoded by both the nuclear genome and organellar genomes, such as those contained within the mitochondria. The content, size, and structure of the mitochondrial genome varies across organisms with potentially large implications for phenotypic variance and resulting evolutionary trajectories. Among yeasts in the subphylum Saccharomycotina, extensive differences have been observed in various species relative to the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but mitochondrial genome sampling across many groups has been scarce, even as hundreds of nuclear genomes have become available. By extracting mitochondrial reads from existing short-read genome sequence datasets, we have greatly expanded both the number of available genomes and the coverage across sparsely sampled clades. Comparison of 353 yeast mitochondrial genomes revealed that, while size and GC content were fairly consistent across species, those in the genera Metschnikowia and Saccharomyces trended larger, while several species in the order Saccharomycetales exhibited lower GC content. Extreme examples for both size and GC content were scattered throughout the subphylum. All mitochondrial genomes shared a core set of protein-coding genes for Complexes III, IV, and V, but they varied in the presence or absence of mitochondrially-encoded canonical Complex I genes. We traced the loss of Complex I genes to a major event in the ancestor of the orders Saccharomycetales and Saccharomycodales, but we also observed several independent losses in the orders Phaffomycetales, Pichiales, and Dipodascales. In contrast to prior hypotheses based on smaller-scale datasets, comparison of evolutionary rates in protein-coding genes showed no bias towards elevated rates among aerobically fermenting (Crabtree/Warburg-positive) yeasts. Mitochondrial introns were widely distributed, but highly enriched in some groups. The majority of mitochondrial introns were poorly conserved within groups, but several were shared within groups, between groups, and even across taxonomic orders, which is consistent with horizontal gene transfer, likely involving homing endonucleases acting as selfish elements. As the number of available fungal nuclear genomes continues to expand, the methods described here to retrieve mitochondrial genome sequences from these datasets will prove invaluable to ensuring that studies of fungal mitochondrial genomes keep pace with their nuclear counterparts.",

    "title": "The Genetics of Aerotolerant Growth in Zymomonas mobilis",
    "description": "Reduced genome bacteria are genetically simplified systems that facilitate biological study and industrial use. The free-living Alphaproteobacterium, Zymomonas mobilis, has a naturally reduced genome containing fewer than 2000 protein coding genes. Despite its small genome, Z. mobilis thrives in diverse conditions including the presence or absence of atmospheric oxygen. However, insufficient characterization of essential and conditionally essential genes has limited broader adoption of Z. mobilis as a model Alphaproteobacterium. Here, we use genome-scale CRISPRi-seq to systematically identify and characterize Z. mobilis genes that are conditionally essential for aerotolerant or anaerobic growth, or are generally essential across both conditions. Comparative genomics revealed that the essentiality of most \"generally essential\" genes was shared between Z. mobilis and other Alphaproteobacteria, validating Z. mobilis as reduced genome model. Among conditionally essential genes, we found that the DNA repair gene, recJ, was critical only for aerobic growth but reduced the mutation rate under both conditions. Further, we show that genes encoding the F1FO ATP synthase and Rnf respiratory complex are required for anaerobic growth of Z. mobilis. Combining CRISPRi partial knockdowns with metabolomics and membrane potential measurements, we determined that the ATP synthase generates membrane potential that is consumed by Rnf to power downstream processes. Rnf knockdown strains accumulated isoprenoid biosynthesis intermediates, suggesting a key role for Rnf in powering essential biosynthetic reactions. Our work establishes Z. mobilis as a streamlined model for alphaproteobacterial genetics, has broad implications in bacterial energy coupling, and informs Z. mobilis genome manipulation for optimized production of valuable isoprenoid-based bioproducts",

    "description": "‘Marginal lands’ are low productivity sites abandoned from agriculture for reasons such as low or high soil water content, challenging topography, or nutrient deficiency. To avoid competition with crop production, cellulosic bio- energy crops have been proposed for cultivation on marginal lands, however on these sites they may be more strongly affected by environmental stresses such as low soil water content. In this study we used rainout shelters to in- duce low soil moisture on marginal lands and determine the effect of soil water stress on switchgrass growth and the subsequent production of bioetha- nol. Five marginal land sites that span a latitudinal gradient in Michigan and Wisconsin were planted to switchgrass in 2013 and during the 2018–2021 growing seasons were exposed to reduced precipitation under rainout shelters in comparison to ambient precipitation. The effect of reduced precipitation was related to the environmental conditions at each site and biofuel produc- tion metrics (switchgrass biomass yields and composition and ethanol pro- duction). During the first year (2018), the rainout shelters were designed with 60% rain exclusion, which did not affect biomass yields compared to ambient conditions at any of the field sites, but decreased switchgrass fermentability at the Wisconsin Central–Hancock site. In subsequent years, the shelters were redesigned to fully exclude rainfall, which led to reduced biomass yields and inhibited fermentation for three sites. When switchgrass was grown in soils with large reductions in moisture and increases in temperature, the potential for biofuel production was significantly reduced, exposing some of the chal- lenges associated with producing biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass grown under drought conditions.",

    "description": "Scientific advances due to conceptual or technological innovations can be revealed by examining how research topics have evolved. But such topical evolution is difficult to uncover and quantify because of the large body of literature and the need for expert knowledge in a wide range of areas in a field. Using plant biology as an example, we used machine learning and language models to classify plant science citations into topics representing interconnected, evolving subfields. The changes in prevalence of topical records over the last 50 years reflect shifts in major research trends and recent radiation of new topics, as well as turnover of model species and vastly different plant science research trajectories among countries. Our approaches readily summarize the topical diversity and evolution of a scientific field with hundreds of thousands of relevant papers, and they can be applied broadly to other fields.",

    "title": "The influence of the number of tree searches on maximum likelihood inference in phylogenomics",
    "description": "Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic inference is widely used in phylogenomics. As heuristic searches most likely find suboptimal trees, it is recommended to conduct multiple (e.g., ten) tree searches in phylogenetic analyses. However, beyond its positive role, how and to what extent multiple tree searches aid ML phylogenetic inference remains poorly explored. Here, we found that a random starting tree was not as effective as the BioNJ and parsimony starting trees in inferring ML gene tree and that RAxML-NG and PhyML were less sensitive to different starting trees than IQ-TREE. We then examined the effect of the number of tree searches on ML tree inference with IQ-TREE and RAxML-NG, by running 100 tree searches on 19,414 gene alignments from 15 animal, plant, and fungal phylogenomic datasets. We found that the number of tree searches substantially impacted the recovery of the best-of-100 ML gene tree topology among 100 searches for a given ML program. In addition, all of the concatenation-based trees were topologically identical if the number of tree searches was >/= 10. Quartet-based ASTRAL trees inferred from 1 to 80 tree searches differed topologically from those inferred from 100 tree searches for 6 /15 phylogenomic datasets. Lastly, our simulations showed that gene alignments with lower difficulty scores had a higher chance of finding the best-of-100 gene tree topology and were more likely to yield the correct trees.",
