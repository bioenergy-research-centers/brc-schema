          Still Images or Photos - A collection of images or photographs that
          are produced by a scientific instrument or that convey scientific
          results of experiments. Scientific images that might constitute a
          dataset could be images of cells or molecules that are typically
          taken with electron microscopes, 3-D structures of proteins or
          nanomaterials, images captured during an accelerator run, images from
          astronomy, etc.

          Specialized Mix - This "type" may be used to indicate a dataset made
          up of content that doesn't fit into one of the other "type"
          categories. The content of a "specialized mix" dataset could have
          some of everything in this list, for example, but is clearly focused
          on data and does not have a "format", such as a technical report that
          is focused on data would.

          Multimedia - An example of a multimedia dataset might be a video of

          number of hours.

          Instrument - Use this option to relate datasets which derive from a
          specific DOE instrument at one of the laboratories or user
          facilities. This creates a central Instrument record with a DOI to
          link out to related datasets.
