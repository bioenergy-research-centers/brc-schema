title: LinkML schema of OSTI Submission Metadata
description: >-
        This schema is a LinkML representation of the OSTI Submission Metadata
        schema, as described here:
        https://www.osti.gov/elink/241-6api.jsp#record-model
        OSTI uses the ELINK API infrastructure.
        This schema corresponds to ELINK 241.6.
        Note: for compatibility with the ELINK API, the schema uses the
        original capitalization, e.g., "record" rather than "Record",
        though the latter is more common in LinkML.
